### Paper Divider

This is a tool I use to help figure out how best to divide up large sheets of paper into small identical sheet with minimal waste. I primarily use this tool to help divide up [washi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washi), or other large sheets of paper, when making [modular origami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_origami).
